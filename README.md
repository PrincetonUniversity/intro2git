# intro2git

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to host presentation about the *very* basics
of **git** and **github** given as a *polmeth* seminar in the
[*Politics Department*](http://www.princeton.edu/politics/) at
[*Princeton University*](http://www.princeton.edu/main/).

It was created with *pandoc*.

## Layout
- source files are in `./doc/in/`
- images used in the presentation are in `./img/`
- pandoc-generated slides (and the abstract) are built to `./doc/out/`
- portable builds require a simple edit in the Makefile
