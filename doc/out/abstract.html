<p>Version control software is well-suited to the needs of academic researchers, especially quantitative social scientists. Whether on the desktop or in the cloud, benefits are realized for individual and collaborative projects, alike. Especially at Princeton, <em>git</em>---one of the many implementations available---makes a good choice. This workshop will begin with the intuition behind version control and, specifically, <em>git</em>. We will cover basic use and walk through a &quot;practical&quot; example. You won't be an expert at using <em>git</em> by the end of the talk. But, you will have the working intuition and vocabulary necessary in order to become that expert.</p>
